Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Zoe, Lucy

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Sunday 1-3 pm

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think it is an OK language. It was tricky at first to remember that I was no longer coding in python, but I'm starting to like it

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Although syntax is different, most of the basic concepts like strings, ints and the random module ae essentially the same. Pseudocode is also 
really great regardless of the language you're coding in. In general, creating a roadmap of what you want to do is always helpful regardless
of the language.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Pseudocode, debugging with print statements, office hours and the discord questions channel were all really helpful. Searching up my questions on youtube and geeksforgeeks helped me get started on the assignment too.
What didn't work was accidentally typing in Python syntax. I have learned not to do that (:
For future students, definitely start the assignment early. It helps to ensure you don't feel stressed out if your goal is to submit
by the initial deadline.
I'm looking forward to working on the section of the rubric labelled Kudos.
